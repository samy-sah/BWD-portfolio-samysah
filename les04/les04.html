	<h2>The Most Poisonous Frogs on Earth</h2>
	<p>a blog dedicated to dart frogs</p>
	<h3>Welcome to my blog!</h3>
	<p>I created this website to gnorant at on wondered relation. Enough at tastes really so cousin am of. Extensive therefore supported by extremity of contented. Is pursuit compact demesne invited elderly be. View him she roof tell her case has sigh. Moreover is possible he admitted sociable concerns. This list is a partial list of animals that are poisonous to humans (and other animals):</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Birds: pitohui, blue-capped ifrit, little shrikethrush</li>
		<li>Frogs and toads: <strong>poison dart frogs</strong>, american toad, mantella...</li>
		<li>Salamanders: pacific newts</li>
		<li>Fish: lionfish, blowfish, pufferfish</li>
		<li>Cephalopods: blue-ringed octopus, Pfeffer's flamboyant cuttlefish</li>
		<li>Insects: blister beetle, birdwings, milkweed butterfly, battus butterfly</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I'm passionate about dart frogs. Thanks for stopping by,</p>

	<h4>Dart Frogs Taxonomy</h4>
	<p>Dart frogs are the focus of major phylogenetic studies, and undergo taxonomic changes frequently. The family Dendrobatidae was revised taxonomically in 2006 and contains 13 genera, with about 170 species, the most populated being:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Hyloxalus, 58 species</li>
		<li>Ameerega, 31 species</li>
		<li>Colostethus (a.k.a. rocket frogs), 21 species</li>
		<li>Ranitomeya (a.k.a. thumbnail dart frogs), 21 species</li>
	</ol>

	<h4>Toxicity</h4>
	<p>Many poison dart frogs secrete lipophilic alkaloid toxins such as batrachotoxin (C31H42N2O6), epibatidine, histrionicotoxin, and pumiliotoxin 251D through their skin. Alkaloids in the skin glands of poison frogs serve as a chemical defense against predation, and they are therefore able to be active alongside potential predators during the day. About 28 structural classes of alkaloids are known in poison frogs.

  	<p>The most toxic of poison dart frog species is Phyllobates terribilis. It is argued that dart frogs do not synthesize their poisons, but sequester the chemicals from arthropod prey items, such as ants, centipedes and mites – the diet-toxicity hypothesis</p>
